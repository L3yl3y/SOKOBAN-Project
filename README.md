# SOKOBAN-Project
Incredibly long and tedious --> but it's a fully-fleshed out AVR project to test my C skills when applied to the ATmega324A microcontroller.

You are required to modify a program to implement additional features. The program is a basic template of the game “Sokoban” and has basic functionality. It will present a start screen upon launch, respond to push button presses or a terminal input “s”/“S” to start the game, then display the first level which contains a map of game objects and a flashing player icon. You can add features such as moving the player, game logic, pausing, audio etc. The various features have diﬀerent levels of diﬃculty and will each contribute a certain number of marks.
